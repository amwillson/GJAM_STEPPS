# Overview

This repo contains code written by AM Willson for Willson et al. (in prep). The code is broken into four sections. The first section organizes the output of the STEPPS pollen vegetation model (previously published). The second section processes downscaled climate reconstructions from Rena Guaita. The third section formats data, runs the model, plots output, and performs out-of-sample validation using the mean relative abundance estimates from STEPPS. The fourth section is identical to the third section, but uses the posterior draws from STEPPS instead of the means. We use the GJAM model to fit the relationship between environmental variables and taxon-level relative abundances across the last 2,000 years of the pre-Industrial Holocene across the Upper Midwest , US. We use the model to estimate environment-vegetation relationships and residual relationships between taxa.

# Directory structure

## data

**Input** data, **intermediate** data products, and **processed** data products from processing data and combining data sources in space and time. Any data product \< \~250 MB is contained in these directories. Any data product \< 100 MB is pushed to Github. Anything between 100-250 MB is available upon request because the files are too large to be housed on Github. Anything \> 250 MB is stored on an external hard drive, which is reflected in the directory naming conventions. The input data products are ultimately processed and then used in the analysis portion of the workflow.

### input: inputs to this workflow

-   8km.RData: Dataframe with grid cell IDs and grid cell centroids from PLS data. This file was created in <https://github.com/amwillson/historic-modern-environment/>. It is required because the soil data used in this analysis were originally geospatially matched to the PLS data. The PLS grid is the same as the STEPPS grid, so this product is used to simply match the soil and STEPPS grids in the same way.
-   gridded_soil.RData: Dataframe with soil data across space from gSSURGO. The file was created in <https://github.com/amwillson/historic-modern-environment/> for the modern period, which we assume is consistent with the paleorecord.
-   total_matched.RData: Dataframe with the mapping from PLS points to PLS grid cells. This file was created in <https://github.com/amwillson/historic-modern-environment/>. This dataframe tells us which grid cell each PLS point falls within. Used to determine which STEPPS grid cell each climate grid cell falls within, based on which PLS point each climate grid cell is closest to.
-   msb-paleon-2: directory downloaded from <https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/338e778c00b13acd278302e82f992415>. Contains mean and SD of STEPPS relative abundance
    -   2Kyrs_Comp_Mean_Level2_v1.0.nc: mean relative abundance from STEPPS
    -   2Kyrs_Comp_SD_Level2_v1.0.nc: standard deviation of relative abundance from STEPPS. Not used.
    -   manifest.txt: Manifest file from archived data product
    -   msb-paleon.22.1.report.xml: Documentation for archived data product
    -   msb-paleon.22.1.txt: Documentation for archived data product
    -   msb-paleon.22.1.xml: Documentation for archived data product
-   PLS_point: directory with RData files each containing point-level observations of taxon occurrences from the Public Land Survey (PLS). Files were generated in <https://github.com/amwillson/historic-modern-environment/>. The STEPPS model was calibrated on the PLS. We therefore have the PLS points that are in each STEPPS grid cell. Used this relationship to 1) find which PLS point each climate reconstruction is closest to; 2) identify which grid cell each PLS point falls within; and 3) average over all climate reconstrutions in teh same grid cell according to which PLS point it is closest to.
